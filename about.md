### LONG RIDES

Long rides is a site for exploration and appreciation of natural beauty. We collect the best videos of long trips from around the web for you to enjoy. We're also currently running a [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/267162915/long-video-of-the-trans-siberian-railway) to document the Trans-Mongolian line of the Trans-Siberian Railway. 

These are perfect ambiance videos for nearly any situation, injecting a bit of inspiration, wonder, and wanderlust into the atmosphere.
