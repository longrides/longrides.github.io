### LONG RIDES

Long rides is a site for exploration and appreciation of natural beauty. We collect the best videos of long trips from around the web for you to enjoy. We're also currently running a [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/267162915/long-video-of-the-trans-siberian-railway) to document the Trans-Mongolian line of the Trans-Siberian Railway. 

These are perfect ambiance videos for nearly any situation, injecting a bit of inspiration, wonder, and wanderlust into the atmosphere. 

### Contact me

If you have any suggestions, or especially if you have any videos that would fit the site, please send me an email. I'm trying to focus on higher quality videos that are at least an hour long.
